#percolation
These codes study percolation for overdensity (`..._struc.c`) and underdensity (`..._void.c`) segments in the field for various threholds.
Let us assume that the field is a density field (\rho(x)): for a particular threshold \rho_{th}:

1. all the points with \rho(x)>=\rho_{th} falls in overdensity segment: cluster-statistics studied by NC_finder_all_parallel_new_struc.c
2. all the points with \rho(x)<\rho_{th} falls in underdensity segment: cluster-statistics studied by NC_finder_all_parallel_new_void.c


The input file is required to have same format.

The codes need mpicc to be compiled and mpirun/mpiexec for running. 

mpicc <code_name.c> -lm -o <name.o>
mpirun -np <# of processors> ./<name.o> <rho_th_min> <rho_th_max> <no. of steps>

<rho_th_min>=minimum threshold
<rho_th_max>=maximum threshold
<no. of steps>= no of steps in the threshold
by default the code takes linear steps from <rho_th_min> to <rho_th_max>. But it can be easily switched to logscale steps.

The output of the percolation codes has 9 colums: rho_th,NC,ff, percolation_no, NN_max, count_max,ncpoints,count1, LCS.
We possibly only need 1st (rho_th), 3rd (ff), 4th (percolation_no), 6th (count_max), 7th (ncpoints) and 9th (LCS). 
The sharp transition in LCS vs FF plot should indicate percolation transition.
