#percolation
These codes study percolation for overdensity (`..._struc.c`) and underdensity (`..._void.c`) segments in the field for various threholds.

The input file is required to have same format.

The codes need mpicc to be compiled and mpirun/mpiexec for running. 

mpicc <code_name.c> -lm -o <name.o>
mpirun -np <# of processors> ./<name.o> <rho_th_min> <rho_th_max> <no. of steps>

<rho_th_min>=minimum threshold
<rho_th_max>=maximum threshold
<no. of steps>= no of steps in the threshold
by default the code takes linear steps from <rho_th_min> to <rho_th_max>. But it can be easily switched to logscale steps.
